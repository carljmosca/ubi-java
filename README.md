# ubi-java

This image is a base Java image which leverages Red Hat's [Universal Base Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image).  
While there are a number Java images, including some which are much smaller, this effort grew out of a desire to work with a
RHEL-based image due to familiarity.  It also respects the arbitrary-user concept leveraged by the OpenShift Container Platform.
